# slot-machine
a basic python slot machine







you start with 1000 coins. you input your bet, and press enter twice. if 2 symbols match, 2x your bet. if 3 symbols match, 10x your bet. if you somehow manage to get 3 stars, you hit the jackpot and get 1000x your bet. inputting 0 will quit. if you hit 0 coins, the game will automatically end and you're going to have to restart it.
